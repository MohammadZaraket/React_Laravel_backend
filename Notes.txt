Notes of debugging faced in this project:

1st:  TypeError: Tymon\JWTAuth\JWTGuard: :__construct(): Argument #2 ($provider) must be of type Illuminate\Contracts\Auth\UserProvider, null given, called in C:\xampp\htdocs\React_Laravel_backend\vendor\tymon\jwt-auth\src\Providers\AbstractServiceProvider.php on line 100 in file C:\xampp\htdocs\React_Laravel_backend\vendor\tymon\jwt-auth\src\JWTGuard.php on line 60

SOLVED BY: Configure Auth guard
Now, we need to set up the JWT Auth Guard to secure the Laravel applicationâ€™s authentication process. Laravel guard uses the session driver to protect the guards. However, we set the defaults guard to api, and the api guards is ordered to use jwt driver

Place the following code in config/auth.php file.

<?php
return [
    'defaults' => [
        'guard' => 'api',
        'passwords' => 'users',
    ],

    'guards' => [
        'web' => [
            'driver' => 'session',
            'provider' => 'users',
        ],
        'api' => [
            'driver' => 'jwt',
            'provider' => 'users',
            'hash' => false,
        ],
    ],

 keep what's in the file THEN ADD THESE
